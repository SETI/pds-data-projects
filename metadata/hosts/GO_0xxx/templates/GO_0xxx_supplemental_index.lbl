# Index file template for Galileo SSI.  
#
#  This template controls the creation of index files.  The procedure for
#  generating index files for a host is as follows.  Files referred to below
#  should be copied into the top directory for the collection, e.g., GO_0xxx:
#
#  1. Copy and edit this template and the host_defs file (see below).
#  2. Copy and edit the <collection>_index.py script to reflect the 
#     type of index and glob pattern for the data files.
#  3. Copy and edit index_config.py to address any host-dependent
#     processing.
#  4. Run <collection>_index.py from the collection top directory.
#
#  In the host_defs files, replace all values describing the new host.  
#  In this template, quantities enclosed in dollar signs are automatically 
#  filled in and should not be edited.  Add a column for each quantity to be 
#  copied from the product label into the index.  For quantities that require 
#  processing beyond simply copying from the product label and reformatting, 
#  a key function should be provided in index_config.py, defined as :
#
#           key__<COLUMN NAME>(name, label),
#
#  which returns the value to place in the index.
