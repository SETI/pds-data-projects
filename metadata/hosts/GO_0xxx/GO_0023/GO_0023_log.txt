SPICE(NOFRAMECONNECT) -- sxform -- At epoch 2.0833674181568E+07 TDB (2000 AUG 29 15:07:54.181 TDB), there is insufficient information available to transform from reference frame 1 (J2000) to reference frame -77001 (GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM). GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM is a CK frame; a CK file containing data for instrument or structure -77001 at the epoch shown above, as well as a corresponding SCLK kernel, must be loaded in order to use this frame. Failure to find required CK data could be due to one or more CK files not having been loaded, or to the epoch shown above lying within a coverage gap or beyond the coverage bounds of the loaded CK files. It is also possible that no loaded CK file has required angular velocity data for the input epoch, even if a loaded CK does have attitude data for that epoch. You can use CKBRIEF with the -dump option to display coverage intervals of a CK file.

GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM is a CK frame; a CK file containing data for instrument or structure -77001 at the epoch shown above, as well as a corresponding SCLK kernel, must be loaded in order to use this frame. Failure to find required CK data could be due to one or more CK files not having been loaded, or to the epoch shown above lying within a coverage gap or beyond the coverage bounds of the loaded CK files. It is also possible that no loaded CK file has required angular velocity data for the input epoch, even if a loaded CK does have attitude data for that epoch. You can use CKBRIEF with the -dump option to display coverage intervals of a CK file.

SPICE(NOFRAMECONNECT) -- sxform -- At epoch 4.4027261581307E+07 TDB (2001 MAY 25 01:47:41.581 TDB), there is insufficient information available to transform from reference frame 1 (J2000) to reference frame -77001 (GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM). GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM is a CK frame; a CK file containing data for instrument or structure -77001 at the epoch shown above, as well as a corresponding SCLK kernel, must be loaded in order to use this frame. Failure to find required CK data could be due to one or more CK files not having been loaded, or to the epoch shown above lying within a coverage gap or beyond the coverage bounds of the loaded CK files. It is also possible that no loaded CK file has required angular velocity data for the input epoch, even if a loaded CK does have attitude data for that epoch. You can use CKBRIEF with the -dump option to display coverage intervals of a CK file.

GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM is a CK frame; a CK file containing data for instrument or structure -77001 at the epoch shown above, as well as a corresponding SCLK kernel, must be loaded in order to use this frame. Failure to find required CK data could be due to one or more CK files not having been loaded, or to the epoch shown above lying within a coverage gap or beyond the coverage bounds of the loaded CK files. It is also possible that no loaded CK file has required angular velocity data for the input epoch, even if a loaded CK does have attitude data for that epoch. You can use CKBRIEF with the -dump option to display coverage intervals of a CK file.

GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM is a CK frame; a CK file containing data for instrument or structure -77001 at the epoch shown above, as well as a corresponding SCLK kernel, must be loaded in order to use this frame. Failure to find required CK data could be due to one or more CK files not having been loaded, or to the epoch shown above lying within a coverage gap or beyond the coverage bounds of the loaded CK files. It is also possible that no loaded CK file has required angular velocity data for the input epoch, even if a loaded CK does have attitude data for that epoch.

SPICE(NOFRAMECONNECT) -- sxform -- At epoch 4.1341119776142E+07 TDB (2001 APR 23 23:38:39.776 TDB), there is insufficient information available to transform from reference frame 1 (J2000) to reference frame -77001 (GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM). GLL_SCAN_PLATFORM is a CK frame; a CK file containing data for instrument or structure -77001 at the epoch shown above, as well as a corresponding SCLK kernel, must be loaded in order to use this frame. Failure to find required CK data could be due to one or more CK files not having been loaded, or to the epoch shown above lying within a coverage gap or beyond the coverage bounds of the loaded CK files. It is also possible that no loaded CK file has required angular velocity data for the input epoch, even if a loaded CK does have attitude data for that epoch. You can use CKBRIEF with the -dump option to display coverage intervals of a CK file.
