  for which the permitted values are:

     Far Infrared    The wavelength is between approximately 30 and 300 micrometers
     Gamma Ray       The wavelength is less than approximately 0.01 nm
     Infrared        The wavelength is between approximately 0.75 and 300 micrometers
     Microwave       The wavelength is between millimeters and approximately one meter
     Millimeter      The wavelength is between approximately one and a few millimeters
     Near Infrared   The wavelength is between approximately 0.65 and 5.0 micrometers
     Radio           The wavelength is between millimeters and hundreds of thousands of meters
     Submillimeter   The wavelength is between approximately 0.3 and 1.0 millimeters
     Ultraviolet     The wavelength is between approximately 10 and 400 nm
     Visible         The wavelength is between approximately 390 and 700 nm
     Xray            The wavelength is between approximately 0.01 and 10 nm
     
  Look-up tables of filter combination vs. wavelength range are in
  iss-filter-to-wavelength.xlsx

  These are based on information in the SIS and the two instrument.cat 
  files. Rob's table from OPUS may have filter combinations not covered 
  in this file.

Target_ Identification
  Required attributes are name and type. I've include optional 
  alternate_designation attributes, a caveat in an optional 
  description attribute, and an optional Internal_Reference class.
  
  Type has an enumerated list. Target type information is not in the 
  PDS3 label. Can we use the code Mark developed to populate 
  Target_Identification in the HST pipeline?
