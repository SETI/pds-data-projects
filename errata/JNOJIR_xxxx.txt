The file JNOJIR_2xxx/CALIB/JIR_SPE_RESPONSIVITY_V02.LBL is the same in every
volume.  However, in JNOJIR_2041 and JNOJIR_2042, the version obtained from
the Atmospheres Node is slightly different.  Specifically, it refers to the
associated data file as JIR_SPE_RESPONSIVITY_V03 instead of
JIR_SPE_RESPONSIVITY_V02, which causes validation to throw an error.

We have corrected this error, so that JIR_SPE_RESPONSIVITY_V02.LBL is the same
in JNOJIR_2041 and JNOJIR_2042 as in all other JNOJIR_2xxx volumes.  We have
regenerated tar.gz files and checksums accordingly, and the volume passes
validation.
